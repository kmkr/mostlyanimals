Latin	Amphiprion ocellaris
Tags	anemonefish clownfish philippines 2013 anemone dauin
Desc	While sea anemones are poisonous to most fish, the clownfish is immune to their stinging tentacles. Together, they form a symbiotic relationship where the clownfish gets protection from predators and anemone benefits from the clownfish' natural activity. For example, the wedging swimming movements from the clownfish stimulate water sirculation around its tentacles, increasing metabolism and growth.

Desc	Clownfish hatch near the surface and travel deeper to search for a host anemone when they reach their juvenile stage. Each anemone with a clownfish population has a strict hierarchy where juveniles begin at the bottom and may easily be victims to agression, and possibly eviction, from more mature clownfish.

Desc	Flatworms lack circulatory and respiratory organs, oxygen is instead taken up through the entire body. They have the same bright colors as nudibranchs and approximately the same length but is a completely different animal. It's easy to distinguish the two animals as flatworms lack the antennas/rhinophores, move faster and are (duh) flat.

Title	Bobbit Worm
Latin	Eunice aphroditois
Tags	worm anilao 2014 philippines
Desc	The bobbit can grow up to three meters, has a stunning purple iridescence, five antennae to sense passing fish and a scissor-like mouth to split prey in half. Only small parts of the body is exposed, just enought to ambush surprised fish. This worm is quite rare, shy, and mysterious as well. Not much is known about its behaviour. It's theorized that the worm doesnâ€™t see at all but use its excellent receptors to movements in the water to sense nearby fish. The bobbit was one of my reasons to go to Anilao.

Desc	Nudibranch have external gills, hence the name which translates to "naked gill". And unlike many other sea slugs, they don't have a shell. They shed their shell after their larval stage and have developed other teqniques for protection, such as toxic secretion. A few make their own poisons, but most use the toxic metabolites from what they eat for their own defense. Their brightly colored bodies are beautiful, but rather than using it for vanity they use it to show potential predators that they are poisonous.

Desc	On a tiny island just outside Mindoro lives an old parrot named Klara. She is watched over by the owners of the island. I didn't like it at first, but over time I learned there was more to it than just keeping a parrot as a pet. In fact, the story is very touching but too long to write here. Ask me one time if you want to hear it.

Desc	The word "dugong" means lady of the sea, they are believed to be inspirations behind tales or mermaids and in parts of Indonesia they are considered reincarnations of women. The dugong is herbivorous and feed uniquely on sea grass. Their numbers are very low and in some countries entirely gone due to hunting,  bycatch and habitat desctruction. I was extremely lucky to encounter one in Marsha Shouna on the western coast of the Red Sea, once home to thousands of dugongs but now with very few. The 100 km coastline along Marsa Alam have now only seven dugongs left.
