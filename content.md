Latin	Amphiprion ocellaris
Loc		Dumaguete, The Philippines
Tags	anemonefish clownfish 2013 anemone
Desc	Sea anemones are, to most fish, poisonous. The clownfish however is immune to their stinging tentacles and they form a symbiotic relationship where the clownfish receive protection from predators and the anemone benefits from the clownfish' natural activity. For example, the wedging swimming movements from the clownfish stimulate water sirculation around its tentacles, increasing metabolism and growth.

Tags	anemonefish clownfish 2013 anemone
Latin	Amphiprion ocellaris
Desc	Clownfish hatch near the surface and travel deeper to search for a host anemone when they reach their juvenile stage. Within a clownfish population there is a strict hierarchy where juveniles begin at the bottom and may easily be victims to agression, and possibly eviction from the anemone, by more mature clownfish.

Latin	Pseudoceros ferrugineus
Tags	2013 worm
Desc	Flatworms lack circulatory and respiratory organs (such as gills), and respiration is performed by diffusion through the worm's entire surface. They have the same bright colors as nudibranchs and approximately the same length but is a completely different animal. It's easy to distinguish the two animals as flatworms lack the antennas/rhinophores, generally move faster and are (duh) flat.

They are chemical sensors used to smell and taste the chemicals dissolved in the water, such as food and potential mates. Most nudibranchs can retracted these vital organs as protection against other fish.

You may wonder why the whip is called black coral when it's bright green. Its inner skeleton is black and the flesh varies in color. P. Unciger shrimps adept by changing their own color to match the coral's color.

Only small parts of the body is exposed, just enought to ambush surprised fish. This worm is quite rare, shy, and mysterious as well. Not much is known about its behaviour. It's theorized that the worm doesnâ€™t see at all but use its excellent receptors to movements in the water to sense nearby fish. The bobbit was one of my reasons to go to Anilao.

Desc	Night dives at the Anilao pier feels like something from another world. The sandy bottom comes to life from all the crabs, shrimps, slugs and bottom dwellers doing their brutal routine. Many of these animals feed at night, and the site had become a large battlefield for the tiny creatures living there. The starfish were many and moving fast, climbing over animals and any obstructing ground they collided into, stopping only to devour the delicious molluscs their tube feet got attached to. Countless squids dancing around in the dark, moving just outside the beam of our lights while concurrently exploiting it for the ongoing hunt. A stargazer landed on the sand and burrowed its tapered body, exposing only its big, heavy, flat head and a vertically slanted mouth. The stargazer waits for passing fish before it jumps upwards while it creates a vacuum to suck in the prey

On the matter of reproducing this anemone can do it both sexually and asexually - it can actually clone itself. Did I mention it's an awesome animal?

Desc	Unlike many other sea slugs, nudibranchs lack a shell. As a larva they have, but they shed it when they mature. Shells are heavy and make moving around difficult. Most molluscs use the shell as a primary defence, but nudibranchs have developed other teqniques for protection, such as toxic secretion. A few make their own poisons, but most use the toxic metabolites from what they eat for their own defence.

It dropped to one thousandth. Now I've heard speculations of much less. Previously suffering from unrestricted exploitation by humans, turtles are now having more like a global protection status. However, their slow reproductive rate, combined with increased development in coastal areas make the species very vulnerable. Many turtles are also lost due to accidental catch by fishermen.
