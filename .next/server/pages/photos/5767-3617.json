They are chemical sensors used to smell and taste the chemicals dissolved in the water, such as food and potential mates. Many species of nudibranchs can retract these vital organs to protect them against other fish.","latin":"Nembrotha chamberlaini","location":"Anilao, The Philippines","tags":["nudibranch","2014"],"mode":"landscape","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5767-3617/thumb_DSC02648.jpg","width":220,"height":124},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5767-3617/xs_DSC02648.jpg","width":500,"height":281},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5767-3617/s_DSC02648.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5767-3617/m_DSC02648.jpg","width":1400,"height":788},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5767-3617/l_DSC02648.jpg","width":1900,"height":1069},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5767-3617/xl_DSC02648.jpg","width":2560,"height":1440}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5767-3617/thumb_DSC02648.jpg 220w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5767-3617/xs_DSC02648.jpg 500w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
