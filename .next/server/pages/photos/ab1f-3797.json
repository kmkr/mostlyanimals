Most reefs bleach and die off in such conditions while the Red Sea corals linger on. They are remarkably resilient to high temperatures. Scientists are trying to figure out the key to this crucial ability, with hope of some day be able to salvage reefs currently suffering from rising sea temperatures in other parts of the world.","latin":null,"location":"Egypt","tags":["2015","coral"],"mode":"portrait","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ab1f-3797/thumb_DSC07475.jpg","width":165,"height":220},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ab1f-3797/xs_DSC07475.jpg","width":375,"height":500},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ab1f-3797/s_DSC07475.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ab1f-3797/m_DSC07475.jpg","width":1050,"height":1400},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ab1f-3797/l_DSC07475.jpg","width":1425,"height":1900},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ab1f-3797/xl_DSC07475.jpg","width":1920,"height":2560}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ab1f-3797/thumb_DSC07475.jpg 165w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ab1f-3797/xs_DSC07475.jpg 375w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ab1f-3797/s_DSC07475.jpg 750w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
