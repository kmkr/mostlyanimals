They are fast swimmers, so if they are around, they are not necessarily for long. Most often I will not find them, but sometimes I do, and some of these encounters I believe are the dolphins approaching me more than the other way around. They are curious, playful and intelligent creatures.","latin":"Stenella longirostris","location":"Egypt","tags":["2014","dolphin","pod"],"mode":"landscape","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/58d8-eaf4/thumb_DSC06687.jpg","width":220,"height":124},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/58d8-eaf4/xs_DSC06687.jpg","width":500,"height":281},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/58d8-eaf4/s_DSC06687.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/58d8-eaf4/m_DSC06687.jpg","width":1400,"height":788},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/58d8-eaf4/l_DSC06687.jpg","width":1900,"height":1069},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/58d8-eaf4/xl_DSC06687.jpg","width":2560,"height":1440}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/58d8-eaf4/thumb_DSC06687.jpg 220w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/58d8-eaf4/xs_DSC06687.jpg 500w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
