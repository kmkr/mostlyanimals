Shells are heavy and make moving around difficult. Most molluscs use the shell as a primary defence, but nudibranchs have developed other techniques for protection, such as toxic secretion. A few make their own poisons, but most utilize the toxic metabolites from what they eat.","latin":"Janolus sp.","location":"Anilao, The Philippines","tags":["nudibranch","2014"],"mode":"landscape","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/53d7-cc7a/thumb_DSC04854.jpg","width":220,"height":124},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/53d7-cc7a/xs_DSC04854.jpg","width":500,"height":281},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/53d7-cc7a/s_DSC04854.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/53d7-cc7a/m_DSC04854.jpg","width":1400,"height":788},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/53d7-cc7a/l_DSC04854.jpg","width":1900,"height":1069},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/53d7-cc7a/xl_DSC04854.jpg","width":2560,"height":1440}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/53d7-cc7a/thumb_DSC04854.jpg 220w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/53d7-cc7a/xs_DSC04854.jpg 500w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
