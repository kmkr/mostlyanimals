One of my best memories from Cocos was the ascent on a site called Manuelita, which we dove many times. What we didn't realize at first was that the hammerheads had disperged and moved away when we got there. Immediately when we started to ascend they returned. During our safety stop we saw the hoards coming from all directions and reuniting at the cleaning stations on the ocean floor.","latin":"Sphyrna lewini","location":"Cocos Island, Costa Rica","tags":["2017","shark"],"mode":"portrait","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/abd5-dde1/thumb_DSC02397.jpg","width":165,"height":220},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/abd5-dde1/xs_DSC02397.jpg","width":375,"height":500},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/abd5-dde1/s_DSC02397.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/abd5-dde1/m_DSC02397.jpg","width":1050,"height":1400},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/abd5-dde1/l_DSC02397.jpg","width":1425,"height":1900},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/abd5-dde1/xl_DSC02397.jpg","width":1920,"height":2560}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/abd5-dde1/thumb_DSC02397.jpg 165w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/abd5-dde1/xs_DSC02397.jpg 375w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/abd5-dde1/s_DSC02397.jpg 750w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
