The reason for that is not entirely clear, but the goatfish is presumably a more preferred prey than the bluestrip snapper. So there may be some goatfish in the fish ball as well.","latin":"Lutjanus kasmira and Lutjanus lutjanus","location":"Dampier Strait, Raja Ampat, Indonesia","tags":["fish","school","2019"],"mode":"portrait","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/0f15-e05e/thumb_2019-indo-DSC01548.jpg","width":165,"height":220},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/0f15-e05e/xs_2019-indo-DSC01548.jpg","width":375,"height":500},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/0f15-e05e/s_2019-indo-DSC01548.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/0f15-e05e/m_2019-indo-DSC01548.jpg","width":1050,"height":1400},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/0f15-e05e/l_2019-indo-DSC01548.jpg","width":1425,"height":1900},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/0f15-e05e/xl_2019-indo-DSC01548.jpg","width":1920,"height":2560}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/0f15-e05e/thumb_2019-indo-DSC01548.jpg 165w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/0f15-e05e/xs_2019-indo-DSC01548.jpg 375w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/0f15-e05e/s_2019-indo-DSC01548.jpg 750w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
