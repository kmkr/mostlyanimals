Once, the estimate was one percent. It dropped to one thousandth. Previously suffering from unrestricted exploitation by humans, turtles are now having more like a global protection status. However, their slow reproductive rate, combined with increased development in coastal areas make the species very vulnerable. Many turtles are also lost due to accidental catch by fishermen.","latin":"Chelonia mydas","location":"Marsa Alam, Egypt","tags":["2014","turtle"],"mode":"landscape","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/7624-7738/thumb_DSC06743.jpg","width":220,"height":124},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/7624-7738/xs_DSC06743.jpg","width":500,"height":281},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/7624-7738/s_DSC06743.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/7624-7738/m_DSC06743.jpg","width":1400,"height":788},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/7624-7738/l_DSC06743.jpg","width":1900,"height":1069},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/7624-7738/xl_DSC06743.jpg","width":2560,"height":1440}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/7624-7738/thumb_DSC06743.jpg 220w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/7624-7738/xs_DSC06743.jpg 500w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
