While this is by no means unique for an ocean species, it's still fascinating to observe this type of irregularity. Perhaps, a long time ago another species did just the same, and that is why there are creatures (such as you and me) walking on land today.","latin":"Scorpaenopsis diabolus","location":"Anilao, The Philippines","tags":["2014","scorpionfish","fish"],"mode":"landscape","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ce97-1a92/thumb_DSC04665.jpg","width":220,"height":124},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ce97-1a92/xs_DSC04665.jpg","width":500,"height":281},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ce97-1a92/s_DSC04665.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ce97-1a92/m_DSC04665.jpg","width":1400,"height":788},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ce97-1a92/l_DSC04665.jpg","width":1900,"height":1069},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ce97-1a92/xl_DSC04665.jpg","width":2560,"height":1440}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ce97-1a92/thumb_DSC04665.jpg 220w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/ce97-1a92/xs_DSC04665.jpg 500w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
