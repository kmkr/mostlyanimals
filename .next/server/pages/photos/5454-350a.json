As they moved closer we could recognize their fine details, their uniqueness and beauty. Scientists in Australia use the spots on their skin to distinguish them from each other and is the primary method used to count the number of individuals. We dove with all together five minke whales for almost two hours before they perished into the open sea. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience I will never forget.","latin":"Undescribed (Balaenoptera acutorostrata subspecies)","location":"Ribbon Reefs, Great Barrier Reef, Australia","tags":["2010","whale"],"mode":"landscape","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5454-350a/thumb_Kris%20Krister%20276.jpg","width":220,"height":124},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5454-350a/xs_Kris%20Krister%20276.jpg","width":500,"height":281},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5454-350a/s_Kris%20Krister%20276.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5454-350a/m_Kris%20Krister%20276.jpg","width":1400,"height":788},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5454-350a/l_Kris%20Krister%20276.jpg","width":1900,"height":1069},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5454-350a/xl_Kris%20Krister%20276.jpg","width":2560,"height":1440}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5454-350a/thumb_Kris%20Krister%20276.jpg 220w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/5454-350a/xs_Kris%20Krister%20276.jpg 500w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
