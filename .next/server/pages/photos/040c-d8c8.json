I found only one, but they are very well camouflaged and small, so perhaps a second companion was around somewhere. You may wonder why the whip is called black coral when it's bright green, and the reason is due to its black inner skeleton. The outer flesh varies in color and P. Unciger shrimps adapt by changing their own skin to match the coral's color.","latin":"Pontonides unciger","location":"Anilao, The Philippines","tags":["2014","shrimp"],"mode":"landscape","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/040c-d8c8/thumb_DSC02713.jpg","width":220,"height":124},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/040c-d8c8/xs_DSC02713.jpg","width":500,"height":281},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/040c-d8c8/s_DSC02713.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/040c-d8c8/m_DSC02713.jpg","width":1400,"height":788},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/040c-d8c8/l_DSC02713.jpg","width":1900,"height":1069},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/040c-d8c8/xl_DSC02713.jpg","width":2560,"height":1440}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/040c-d8c8/thumb_DSC02713.jpg 220w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/040c-d8c8/xs_DSC02713.jpg 500w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
