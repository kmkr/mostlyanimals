{"pageProps":{"keywords":["Fuchsia Flatworm","Dumaguete","The Philippines","worm"],"photo":{"name":"DSC00792.jpg","key":"f13a-491f","title":"Fuchsia Flatworm","description":"Flatworms lack circulatory and respiratory organs (such as gills), and respiration is performed by diffusion through the worm's entire surface. They are somewhat similar to nudibranchs in appearance, but the similarity is only superficial. It's easy to distinguish them by the lack of antennas/rhinophores, that they generally move faster and are flat - obviously.","latin":"Pseudoceros ferrugineus","location":"Dumaguete, The Philippines","tags":["2013","worm"],"mode":"portrait","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/f13a-491f/thumb_DSC00792.jpg","width":165,"height":220},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/f13a-491f/xs_DSC00792.jpg","width":375,"height":500},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/f13a-491f/s_DSC00792.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/f13a-491f/m_DSC00792.jpg","width":1050,"height":1400},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/f13a-491f/l_DSC00792.jpg","width":1425,"height":1900},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/f13a-491f/xl_DSC00792.jpg","width":1920,"height":2560}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/f13a-491f/thumb_DSC00792.jpg 165w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/f13a-491f/xs_DSC00792.jpg 375w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/f13a-491f/s_DSC00792.jpg 750w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
