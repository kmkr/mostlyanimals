It can grow up to a meter, has a stunning purple iridescence, five antennae to sense passing fish and a scissor-like mouth to split prey in half. Most of the body is covered in sand, just enough is exposed to ambush surprised fish. This worm is quite rare, shy, and mysterious.","latin":"Eunice aphroditois","location":"Anilao, The Philippines","tags":["worm","2014","portrait"],"mode":"portrait","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/8a84-1f32/thumb_DSC03425.jpg","width":165,"height":220},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/8a84-1f32/xs_DSC03425.jpg","width":375,"height":500},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/8a84-1f32/s_DSC03425.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/8a84-1f32/m_DSC03425.jpg","width":1050,"height":1400},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/8a84-1f32/l_DSC03425.jpg","width":1425,"height":1900},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/8a84-1f32/xl_DSC03425.jpg","width":1920,"height":2560}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/8a84-1f32/thumb_DSC03425.jpg 165w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/8a84-1f32/xs_DSC03425.jpg 375w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/8a84-1f32/s_DSC03425.jpg 750w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
