As this ship already was suspected by the DEA, a search was quickly conducted and 11.000 kg of marijuana was found. The owner of the ship however, was not. Hilma Hooker was starting to wear down and the hull was in dire need of maintenance. It was towed a couple of kilometers south in fear of disrupting boat traffic in case it sunk, which it promtly did. Now it's a great dive site, easily accessible on the western coast of Bonaire.","latin":null,"location":"Bonaire, The Netherlands","tags":["2016","wreck","diver"],"mode":"landscape","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/cf39-c549/thumb_DSC01316.jpg","width":220,"height":124},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/cf39-c549/xs_DSC01316.jpg","width":500,"height":281},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/cf39-c549/s_DSC01316.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/cf39-c549/m_DSC01316.jpg","width":1400,"height":788},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/cf39-c549/l_DSC01316.jpg","width":1900,"height":1069},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/cf39-c549/xl_DSC01316.jpg","width":2560,"height":1440}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/cf39-c549/thumb_DSC01316.jpg 220w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/cf39-c549/xs_DSC01316.jpg 500w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
