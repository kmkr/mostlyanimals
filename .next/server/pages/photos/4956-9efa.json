Within a clownfish community there is a strict hierarchy where juveniles begin at the bottom and have to gradually move upwards by proving their abilities to the rest of the population. During this time they may be victims to agression, and possibly eviction from the anemone by more mature clownfish.","latin":"Amphiprion ocellaris","location":"Dumaguete, The Philippines","tags":["anemonefish","clownfish","2013","anemone","fish"],"mode":"landscape","sizes":{"thumb":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/4956-9efa/thumb_DSC00266.jpg","width":220,"height":124},"xsmall":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/4956-9efa/xs_DSC00266.jpg","width":500,"height":281},"small":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/4956-9efa/s_DSC00266.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},"medium":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/4956-9efa/m_DSC00266.jpg","width":1400,"height":788},"large":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/4956-9efa/l_DSC00266.jpg","width":1900,"height":1069},"xlarge":{"url":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/4956-9efa/xl_DSC00266.jpg","width":2560,"height":1440}},"srcSet":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/4956-9efa/thumb_DSC00266.jpg 220w, https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/splendid-nudibranch/4956-9efa/xs_DSC00266.jpg 500w"}},"__N_SSG":true}
